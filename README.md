# Movie-Search
A simple web app to search for movies by their titles. I've used NodeJS in the backend and OMDB api to receive data on the movies. The search results contain upto 10 results related to the search term with their Titles, Poster, Year of Release and a link to their IMDB page.
I have deployed this app on Heroku and it can be viewed from herer : https://movieapprinem.herokuapp.com/
